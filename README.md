# Breakout-Game
This is a simple tile-based game where player controls a platform to prevent balls from falling. Player gets 1 point for breaking a block, and a new ball spawns for every 10 points. 

It is coded from C++ and was inspired by PolyMars videos on Youtube: `https://youtu.be/iEn0ozP-jxc?si=LzACoG4YHoBqW2Sc`
