# Breakout-Game
This is a simple tile-based game coded in C++ and was inspired by PolyMars videos on Youtube: `https://youtu.be/iEn0ozP-jxc?si=LzACoG4YHoBqW2Sc`

Player controls a platform by pressing left or right arrow keys to prevent balls from falling. Player gets 1 point for breaking a block, and a new ball spawns for every 10 points.
